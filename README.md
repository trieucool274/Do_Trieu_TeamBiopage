# Do_Trieu_TeamBiopage

Create a Team Bio page based on your partners for the Integrated Project. You’ll have some
standard team copy on the page initially (written by you); provide a way to click and change
content for each team member

## Reason for Project

Design a bio page! Consider this a page in the context of a larger studio site - look at how “real”
design / dev houses do this, and come up with your own style.
Only one team member’s information should be visible at a time; you’ll provide some way to
click and view each member’s information on demand.
Create an array to hold bio information (text) for each team member. Each team member is
responsible for populating this array with text - add your own! You’ll be retrieving this text on a
click or other event, and putting it into a paragraph tag (or multiple tags) on the page.
You will also include a headline for the team member’s name that will change based on
whose info is currently active
